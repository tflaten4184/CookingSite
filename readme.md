# Purpose
I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, but I've always been curious how much money we save by cooking at home.
I was inspired to build this website to keep all my favorite recipes in one place, in addition to providing a tool for estimating the cost of each recipe.
Unlike other recipe websites, this site displays the total cost of each recipe along with a per-ingredient breakdown of costs.

# How it works
This site uses a database of common ingredients and their correspoding prices and base units. Each recipe is built from these ingredients, which allows us to automatically calculate the cost of the recipe based on its components.
Currently the base price of each ingredient is manually set. Actual cost will vary over time and by region, store, etc.

# Additional features (planned)
Users can make an account to unlock additional features, including:
-rating recipes up to 5 stars
-posting reviews on recipe
-saving their favorite recipes
-managing a shopping list of missing ingredients
-managing kitchen inventory to show you what you can make with ingredients you already own

# Setup
